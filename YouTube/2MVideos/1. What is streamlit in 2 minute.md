Intro: Hi everyone, welcome to my channel! Today I'm going to be talking about Streamlit, an open-source library that makes it easy to build data apps in Python. Whether you're a data scientist, a developer, or just someone who wants to create interactive web apps, Streamlit is a great choice. Let's dive in!

Body: Streamlit is built on top of the popular web framework, Flask, which means that if you're already familiar with Flask, you'll feel right at home with Streamlit. The library also has a "pythonic" API that's easy to understand, so even if you're new to web development, you'll be able to pick it up quickly.

One of the main use cases for Streamlit is building data exploration and visualization apps. The library provides a number of built-in widgets for displaying data, such as tables and charts, as well as tools for building custom widgets. This makes it easy for data scientists and analysts to build apps that allow others to interact with and explore their data.

Another great use case for Streamlit is building machine learning model training and deployment apps. With Streamlit, you can easily add widgets like sliders, dropdown menus, and checkboxes to your app, which allows users to interact with your model and tweak parameters on the fly. Plus, with just one command, you can easily deploy your model on the cloud, making the deployment process extremely easy.

%%In addition to its core features, Streamlit also provides a number of plugins and add-ons that allow you to extend the functionality of your apps. This includes support for maps, forms, and even hosting your app on the cloud.%%

Demo: To give you a better idea of what Streamlit can do, I'm going to walk you through a quick demo of a simple app I built. First, I'll show you how to set up a new Streamlit app, and then I'll show you how to add some widgets to it. Finally, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to deploy your app on the cloud.

Conclusion: As you can see, Streamlit is a powerful library that makes it easy to build interactive web apps in Python. Whether you're a data scientist, a developer, or just someone who wants to create cool interactive apps, Streamlit is a great choice. And with its simple API, ease of deployment and extensibility with plugins, it's definitely worth checking out.

## Script

- Streamlit a relatively new open-source framework for building web-based data science and machine learning applications.
- It was first released in 2018 by the company founded by two former Google engineers, Adrien and Thiago.
- Who were both frustrated with the difficulty of building web-based tools for their own data science projects.
- The name `streamlit` itself is a jock as said by Thiago.

- The goal of Streamlit is to make it easy for data scientists and engineers to build web-based tools for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning.
- Lets imagine using it to create a image editing application.
- we will use many inbuild widgets to get the job done.
- https://github.com/Aadityansha/Image-Editing-App/blob/main/app.py
- start by importing streamlit and pillow.
- we will set title of the page with `set_page_config` and passing the title of the page. set header and subheader. 
- Now use `file_uploader` widget to get image files and only accept the png and jpg images.
- we will read image into image object. 
- we can create sidebas with `st.sidebar` and set the header.
- We will use slider widget to create different sliders for different effects as well as selectbox for options and a checkbox for blulr.
- now set default values for our sliders.
- Use image enhancer to apply different effects to out image.
- to show the image use `image` widget from streamlit.
in under 70 lines of code you have a app that anyone can use on the internet.
