Hey everyone. I just started this YouTube Channel and I didn't had any ideas for youtube videos or series. 

So I did what a normal human being do I thought,.. (Cut in between)
Hmmm not really
I asked an ai for youtube series Idea. and this is how it went...

[Screen Recording]
So, I went to chatGPT and asked a generic question for youtube series idea. 

It came up with many ideas and some of them were very interesting but not in the field of DataScience. 

And Im most comfirtable to talk about datascience.

So I reformed the question and specifically asked for Youtube series idea in the field of datascience.

And then the magic happpned,  it came up with the Idea of "Data Science 101"

It is going to be a series of videos on basics of datascience to more advance datascience.

From [[001. Data collection]]  to [[006. Data visualization]]  and From Exploring the data to training Machine learning models on the data.
