Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. A "Data Science 101" video could cover topics such as:

-   The data science process, including data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation
-   Common data science techniques, such as statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization
-   Popular data science tools and libraries, such as Python, R, SQL, and Pandas
-   Different types of data, including structured and unstructured data, and how to work with them
-   Best practices for data science projects, including data governance, version control, and reproducibility
-   Case studies or examples of data science in action, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

Additionally, you can also include some example of data science projects, like how to collect data using web scraping, how to do exploratory data analysis using visualizations, how to build a simple machine learning model and how to evaluate the model.
