## Scripts

The "Call Down, Signal Up" method is a design pattern that streamlines communication between nodes by adhering to a structured approach:

1. **Call Down (Parent Node):** when a parent node calls or invokes a method on one of its child nodes.
2. **Signal Up (Child Node):** Once the child node receives the call, it processes the request and, if necessary, emits a signal to notify other nodes or the parent node about the result or an event that occurred.

Lets understand with an example of this counter...

Here I have basic scenes setup with buttons and label and have a script attached to the parent as you can see I have two signals coming from buttons connected to the parent 

When the button is pressed it will emit the signal to parent now the parent will set the text property of child label `count`.

- This design pattern provides modularity and encapsulation each node only concerns itself with its specific responsibilities. 
- Child nodes don't need to know about the parent nodes that call their methods. This loose coupling enhances code reusability and flexibility.
