## Script
If you want to improve your debugging skill, godot has a pretty neat feature called `print_rich`.

With print rich you will get colors in godot console. You can use this to debug your code in deferent ways such as printing errors in red, information in blue and success in green. You can use BBCode to customize the output by making it bold, underlined or italic or y changiing background as well as foreground color.

I hope you found this video helpful and learned something new. If you did, please give it a like and subscribe to my channel for more Godot 4 tutorials. Thanks for watching and see you next time!
