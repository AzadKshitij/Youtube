## Scripts

Ever wondered how to categorize your exports like this? 

The export_category keyword is a new feature in Godot 4 that allows you to group your exported variables into categories. This is useful if you have a lot of exported variables in your scripts and you want to keep them organized and tidy. 

To use the export_category keyword, you simply write it before the export keyword, followed by a string that represents the name of the category. For example, if I want to create a category called "Movement" for my player script, I can write:
```gdscript
@export_category("Movement")
@export var speed = 10
@export var jump_height = 5

Now you have Category movement in your inspector and all exported variable below it if you want to add another category add simply put export_category aboe the exported variables.

@export_category("Player Info")
@export var name = "Bit Of Code"
```
