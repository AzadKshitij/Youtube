A box plot, also known as a box and whisker plot, is a graphical representation of a dataset that shows the distribution of values in the data. It is a useful tool for visualizing the spread and skewness of a dataset, as well as identifying outliers.

Here is how to create a box plot:

1.  Collect the data that you want to plot.
2.  Calculate the minimum value, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum value of the data.
3.  Draw a horizontal line to represent the range of the data, and mark the minimum and maximum values at the ends of the line.
4.  Draw a box around the middle 50% of the data, with the bottom of the box at Q1 and the top of the box at Q3.
5.  Mark the median value with a horizontal line inside the box.
6.  Draw "whiskers" extending from the box to the minimum and maximum values.

Here is an example of a box plot:

The box plot can be used to compare the distribution of multiple datasets by creating a box plot for each dataset and placing them side by side. It is also possible to overlay box plots on top of each other to compare the distributions more closely.

I hope this tutorial has helped you understand the basics of box plots. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!

Lets understand boxplot in a minute. 
1. is a graphical representation of a dataset that shows the distribution of values in the data. 
	- The top line is maximum value.
	- Bottom line is minimum value.
	- The Centre line is Median. 
	- Top of the box is 75th percentile value.
	- Bottom of the box is 25th percentile value.
	- You see those circles outside yes those are called 'outliers'.
2. This complete plot is called box-plot.
3. lets see how to create one with python.
	- Start by importing necessary packages. 
	- We will use seaborn to create the plot.
4. Lets use some inbuilt dataset that comes with seaborn. called taxis. and set the style of the graph as white grid.
5. Now define values for the x-axis and y-axis. and define a list of cities you want to create box plot for.
6. Create the plot with `sns.boxplot()` function, and provide `df`  as data. set x as x y as y and order boxplot in order of cities list. 
7. Now use `plt.show()` function to show the graph.
8. So you have your box plot and I'm out of time. Make sure to like and share and subscribe for more.
