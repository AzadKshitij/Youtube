In Python, the `%%timeit` magic command is a handy tool for measuring the execution time of small bits of code. It can be used in both interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks and in scripts.

To use `%%timeit`, you simply place it at the beginning of a cell in a Jupyter notebook, or at the top of a script, followed by the code you want to measure the execution time of. `%%timeit` will then run the code multiple times and return the fastest run time among all the runs.

What is `%%timeit` in python.

It's a magic command that we use to measure the execution time of small bit of code. can be used in  jupyter notebook. 

To use `%%timeit`, you simply place it at the beginning of a cell in a Jupyter notebook, followed by the code you want to measure the execution time of. `%%timeit` will then run the code multiple times and return the fastest run time among all the runs.

The output shows the time it took to run the code in microseconds, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the run times across multiple runs.

The number of runs and loops can be adjusted by passing arguments to `%%timeit`.

```python
%%timeit -r 10 -n 100 
x = 0 
for i in range(10000): 
	x += i
```

In this example, `%%timeit` will run the code 10 times and do 100 loops per run.

`%%timeit` is a useful tool for identifying performance bottlenecks in your code and optimizing the most heavily used sections. It can be especially helpful for comparing the performance of different algorithms or implementations.
