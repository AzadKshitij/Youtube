## Script


**1. Be Active, Not Reactive**
	Make active decision about how you spend your time instead of reacting to every demand on you.  
**2. Set Goals** 
	Setting long- and short-term goals help you know where you are going and what you have to do to get there. It will help you to track what tasks or projects that are unfinished that you need to complete.  
**3. Prioritize actions**
	After your goals are stable, prioritize what you do to achieve each one. Be careful not to let tasks, projects, or relationships that you value fall between the cracks and stay undone.  
**4. Keep your focus**
	Concentrate on one major project at a time even if you jump around on how you complete that project. Whatever the task is that you commit to for all the right reasons, give it your all and keep going till you finish it.  
**5. Create realistic deadlines**
	Deadlines, particularly realistic ones, will assist you in keeping your focus on specific long-term goals and especially on short-term priorities. A deadline that is too far into the future will make it harder to avoid getting committed to too many competing tasks or projects. A deadline that is too soon opens the likelihood that you will be frustrated that you are either working at a pace that is hard to maintain or that you will have to ask for one or more extensions. Try to learn how long tasks really take so you create a realistic deadline, adding just enough time to give yourself an extra cushion in line with the maxim, "Promise less, deliver more."
**6. D-O-I-T-N-O-W**
	Applying this acronym on a regular basis will help you to maximize your productivity:
	D  = Divide and conquer what you must do.
	O  = Organize your materials, how you will do it.\I
	I    = Ignore interruptions that are annoying distractions.
	T   = Take the time to learn how to do things yourself.
	N  = Now, not tomorrow. Don't procrastinate.
	O  = Opportunity is knocking. Take advantage of opportunities.
	W  = Watch out for time gobblers. Keep track of, and in control of, how much time you spend on the Internet, on social media, reading and sending E-mails, watching TV, talking on the phone, or sending, and receiving, text messages.
