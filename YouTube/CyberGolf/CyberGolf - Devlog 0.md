## Scripts
Hey, I'm working on a game that's all about precision and skill., a rage game or whatever term you want to use for these types of games. I want you to feel frustrated while playing the game, but in a fun way. So what is the game I'm actually talking about. well lets dive in and take a look. Hi, I'm Bit Of Code and welcome to my channel.

To give you a pitch my game is as I said a precision platformer more specifically a physics based precision platformer.  Heavily inspired by games such as gold(real world), [Red Ball](https://red-ball4.com/), Bounce.

In this game you are playing as a [Linksman](https://www.google.com/search?q=linksman&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). who can control a power ball by clicking and dragging on the screen. The goal is the get to the portal more like the hole in the game of golf. You'll face various physics-based challenges along the way, and also collect extra points and power-ups that will help you complete the level. I've been working on this game for about three weeks now. 

> [!note] Track mouse in the clip and add  Struggle sound
And this is how it all started: I just finished making an infinite runner mobile game and was out of ideas for another game. So I went to [kenny assets](https://www.kenney.nl/assets) to look for assets and then think of a game idea where I could use them. I decided to make a golf game, but I had no clue how to do it. So, I searched online for a starting point, and then I found exactly what I was looking for. It will be easy Just Press Play Right? Wait Just a second...   2 Eternity Later...
I got the assets and managed to convert them to godot4, as they were made in godot3.

> [!note] Compare both the games use the creator video to show the older version.
I didn't like the initial look of the game, so I designed my own assets with a neon color palette. And this is the result.

so this was the original version and this is how the game looks now. I will definitely be changing the the few more times until I get it right. 

> [!note] Track cursor and change the player movement 
In the Older version the movement didn't feel natural. So I tweaked some parameters to make movement feel natural.  

Now its time to add new mechanics like trampoline, teleporters, switches, moving platforms but before that I wanted to add Main Menu level select screen. and did exactly that. I also added animations for screens using tweens.

I have been hard at work in making different mechanics and adding different interactive elements but I knew for my game to stand out in thousands of games and have a big potential I need good looking assets to make the game look unique in some sense. So everything you are looking at right now its gonna change in future. 

> [!note] show hard working coding mene with analytics meme
I'm mainly programmer and do analytics stuff so art is not really my thing all i can do is change colors make blocks. I will be learning how to create good art for games.

Mean while to keep my interest in the game not feel burned out I decided to make some new levels and boy o boy it was hard. Making new levels might be the hardest thing to do while making games I managed to create few levels but was not impressed with it. I will definitely be changing them in future. For the first release I want to create at least 15 levels for player to beat.  Speaking of which, I have been planning out most of the levels on my physical notebook and its been fun.

I managed to add Trampoline, Teleporters and created levels specifically designed to use the mechanics.

With that I think its time to warp up this first devlog for my game. Don't have much else to say but thanks for watching and remember to subscribe and hit the bell icon take care and see you in the next one.
